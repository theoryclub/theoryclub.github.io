Continuing with the theme of combinatorial optimization and
approximate algorithms, Stephen presented a simple approximate
greedy algorithm for optimizing monotone, submodular set functions.

An example problem is the NP-hard [set cover
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem) or [optimal
sensor placement](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/krause08a/krause08a.pdf).

For more on submodularity, see these
lecture [notes](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~yaron/AM221-S16/lecture_notes/AM221_lecture18.pdf) or my personal [notes](https://lectures.cgdct.moe/misc/gacha-optimization/writeup.pdf#page=35).
