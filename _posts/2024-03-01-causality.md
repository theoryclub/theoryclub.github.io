Jonathan gave a guest lecture on causality.

Abstract: We trace the development of causality from a nebulous concept to a
precise mathematical theory with significant applications in statistics, AI,
econometrics, philosophy, and the biological, health and social sciences. I
will present the historical development, and illustrate the key concepts in
the theory of causation.
