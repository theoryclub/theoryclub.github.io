Neil Thistlethwaite gave a talk on Lattice-based Cryptography.

The first part of the talk involved introducing what a lattice is, along with some properties of lattices. The talk also went over topics
in lattice crypto, such as SVP (Shortest Vector Problem), CVP (Closest
Vector Problem), and GGH (Goldreich–Goldwasser–Halevi lattice-based
cryptosystem).
