First meeting of the semester was a problem session! We had donuts as well as a few very interesting problems about
discrete structures, probability, and set theory. The slides for the problem session are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cAq-9GU3H-qxc3b5Mr-9oRnub0Dqy35unSzF9FrdEpw/edit?usp=sharing)

All of the problems in one nice pdf are <a href="{{ "/files/DonutProblemSession.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.
