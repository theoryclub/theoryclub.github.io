On Monday night we had a gambling Probability Game Night!

We'll explain the rules and games more in detail on
Monday, but the important differences from our usual
meetings that we wanted to let you know about now are:
- Dinner will be provided! We'll be having (tentatively) Ray's NY Pizza for
  the first 30 minutes from 6:30pm - 7pm. Nothing's stopping you from eating
  after 7, but that's when we'll start the games, and time lost is expected
  value lost!
- To make sure we have enough time for the
  games, the meeting will run until 8pm.
- We aren't going to allow computers or phones since it gives too much of an
  advantage if you can write programs, but we will allow calculators[^1], so if
  you have a calculator make sure you bring it! We'll have some extras for
  those who don't and want to use them, but we only have so many.
- It's going to be lots of fun, feel free to bring your friends! That said,
  we aren't actually posting this poster anywhere, so we plan on the event
  being relatively small -- please don't advertise to a group of 200 people
  or anything. ðŸ™‚

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask, although we won't be
leaking any more details about the games until Monday! ðŸ™‚

[^1]: Yes, programmable calculators are allowed, and you can program on it if you really want. We think this is going to be enough of a barrier to stop anyone from cheesing the games too much. ðŸ˜‰
