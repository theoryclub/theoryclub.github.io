We kicked off the fall semester with our first meeting!

The meeting covered:
* What is Theory Club?
* Solution to a variant of Nim
* A brain teaser (involving putting coins on a table)
* Survey of theoretical Computer Science (and open problems).


The slides can be found <a href="{{ "/files/f2020-Intro-to-Theory-Club.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.

Next Monday, Alvin will be giving a talk on graphs. Also, if you have not yet joined the slack, please do so at <a href = "theoryclub.slack.com/signup">here</a> as that is where we will be having our announcements / communications.
