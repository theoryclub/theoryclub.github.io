Today Neil talked about ML theory (but better this time).

Rather than talk about random interesting results, tonight I'm going to
try to present it in a more comprehensive way, with concepts like PAC,
VC-dimensionality, Perceptron, Multi-armed Bandit, Experts, and Weighted
Majority (ok, that was a lot, but I'll try to get to as much of it as I can).

Slides from today can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mMjMvy6IHbMYpDA4_ZWpcr5ldOApFzvbW21ie5cO0cI/edit?usp=sharing).

I'll try to add in the proofs later tonight in case anyone wants to reference
them and here's the link to Vempala's version of the course from last semester:
