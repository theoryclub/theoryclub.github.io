To kick things off, Suhas gave the first meeting
of the spring semester on maximum matchings.

We'll go over the basics of matchings and look at two algorithms for maximum
matchings: Hopcroft-Karp for bipartite graphs and Edmonds' famous Blossom
algorithm for general graphs. If time permits, we may also look at an algorithm
for maximum-weight perfect matchings over bipartite graphs as well.
