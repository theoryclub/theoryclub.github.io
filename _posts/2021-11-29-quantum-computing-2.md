Today Suhas held a lecture (with a few
problems on the side) on quantum computing.

It'll be completely from the ground up so you don't have to know anything
beyond basic linear algebra (i.e. what is a matrix, what is a vector, how do
you multiply). We'll discuss gates, some fundamental problems and quantum
speedups for those problems, and quantum computing in practice. If we have
time, I will also discuss results in recent research.In addition, you may
get to hear me talk trash about IBM ðŸ™‚.
