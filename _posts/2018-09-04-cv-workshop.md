We had our second meeting on Tuesday this week because of Labor Day, and instead of a talk, we had a workshop in preparation for the Home Depot Deep Learning Hackathon.

Arvind gave an introduction to the field of computer vision along with a simple Keras demo on the MNIST dataset. Slides for the workshop are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xyk0Nq-6QzS-pu4l8NNTBZYhcLJFGDxtPsmHRXklyg4/edit#slide=id.p">here</a>, and the code is <a href="https://bit.ly/2Cgzn6b">here</a>.

The Agency, GT's Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning club, ran a follow-up workshop on Generative Adversarial Networks, an advanced network architecture used in many state-of-the-art computer vision models today. The slides for that are <a href="http://gtagency.github.io/2018/intro-to-gans">here</a>.
