Today I (Alvin) talked about some past research I've done, where we
reduced a counting problem in origami into a graph coloring problem
(I'll be bringing some hands-on paper to play around with ðŸ‘€).

More broadly, it falls under Geometric Folding Algorithms
(if you're interested you can find a whole course on it here:
[https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall12/lectures/](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall12/lectures/))
