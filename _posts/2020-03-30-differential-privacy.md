Despite COVID-19, Big-O Theory Club is continuing to run remotely!

We had a talk by Satchit Sivakumar about differential privacy (and how to prove concentration bounds related to Chernoff bounds using differential privacy).

The slides can be found <a href="{{ "/files/s2020-dp-talk.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.

Here is the paper that proved the concentration bounds discussed in the talk: <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03493.pdf"> Subgaussian Tail Bounds via Stability Arguments</a>
