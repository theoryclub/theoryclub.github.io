A guest appearance by our faculty talks coordinator DeVon, we had an introduction to oracles.

Additionally, he talked about Bounded Error Quantum Polynomial Time (BQP) vs. Polynomial Hierarchy (PH) and barriers to proofs in complexity theory.
The slides are <a href="{{ "/files/oraclescomplexity.pptx" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.
