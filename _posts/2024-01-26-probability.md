Stephen covered randomized algorithms for probability.

Specifically, we saw a randomized trace estimator and
its applications to least-squares, stochastic gradient
descent, and Markov chain Monte Carlo for the Ising model.

The lecture was based on these [lecture
notes](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/doi/10.7907/q75sz-e1e79).
