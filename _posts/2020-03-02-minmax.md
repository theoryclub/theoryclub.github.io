Arvind gave a talk on min-max optimization.

The talk included preliminary ideas of optimization (convexity, etc.) and on min-max optimization (well-known algorithms, current research problems, applications)

A good resource to learn about online learning and how it fits into min-max optimization is <a href = "https://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/OCObook.pdf">Introduction to Online Convex Optimization by Elad Hazan</a>
