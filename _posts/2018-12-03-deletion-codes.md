For our final meeting of the semester, we had professor Venkat Guruswami present a talk on deletion codes, a subset of error-correction codes.

Thank you to everyone who came to Big O this semester! We'll see you next year!

The slides for the talk are <a href="{{ "/files/deletion-codes.pptx" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.
