Daniel will be giving a guest lecture on Turing
machines, computability, and undecidable problems.

Daniel's website may be found [here](https://blog.danielclu.com/).

These considerations occur surprisingly often (e.g. in
programming languages) and are at the heart of foundational
issues in computing and mathematics (e.g. provability).
