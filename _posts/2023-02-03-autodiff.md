Stephen talked about automatic differentiation (autodiff) techniques
including finite differencing, forward-mode autodiff, and
reverse-mode autodiff, more commonly known as "backpropagation".

The talk ended with discussing how checkpoints can save memory in reverse-mode
autodiff, optimally trading off between space usage and computational time.
