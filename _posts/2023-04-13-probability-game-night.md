We hosted our annual Probability Game Night event.

We'll have a selection of games involving coin flipping, card patterns, and
estimation. There will be pizza provided and prizes for the top 5 players.

The logistics can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SlG4i84blsg7HsfMZmgEYM0xy7_TXRVI5Rm0oIy71Wc/edit?usp=sharing).

Note that like the CMU event earlier, this
will replace the usual Friday meeting.
