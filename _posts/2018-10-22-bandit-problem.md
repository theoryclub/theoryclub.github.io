We had our first faculty talk by Dr. Jacob Abernethy today! Dr. Abernethy recently joined GT as part of the theoretical CS department. He currently teaches CS 4540 (Advanced Algorithms) and Graduate ML Theory. His talk was on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed bandit problem</a> and more generally, solving zero-sum games without the iid requirements that are prevalent in much of ML theory today. Click <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/600231/top-machine-learning-researcher-jake-abernethy-joins-school-computer-science">here</a> to learn more about Dr. Abernethy (and his juggling skills).

If you are interested in an REU, there is a Google doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG_0dAAmoaLN1rHJsxfR0EGiiWCum6KZ0sBFW2Gy578/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> with helpful information for applying.
