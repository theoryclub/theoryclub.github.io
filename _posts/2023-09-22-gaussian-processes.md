Stephen started a two-part series on Gaussian processes (GPs), a Bayesian,
nonparametric statistical model with built-in uncertainty quantification.

This week will be investigating the mathematical and
computational properties of multivariate Gaussians in
R^n, which occur in a wide variety of applications.

The slides may be found [here]({{
"/files/gp1.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Next week will be its infinite dimensional generalization
to functional spaces, the RKHS theory, and a GP tutorial.
