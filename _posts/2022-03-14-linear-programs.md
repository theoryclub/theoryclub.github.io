Arvind gave a talk about linear programs, LP duality,
and how to solve LP's using interior point methods.

If time permits, I may also talk about a faster
(\tilde{O}(n^omega) ðŸ‘€) version of IPMs. \\
(My talk was somewhat based on this paper:
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04734)).

Oh btw one can use LP duality to prove max flow = min cut over the integers. \\
But you need to utilize additional properties
(one of them is that A is totally unimodular
