Jerry will be giving a guest lecture on AlphaTensor, starting with a
brief overview of reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search.

Jerry's website can be found [here](https://jxiong21029.github.io/).

We'll resume with the GP tutorial next week. As always,
message an officer if you want to guest lecture!
