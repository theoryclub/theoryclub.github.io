Today Suhas introduced linear programming.

Linear programming is very useful in industry and academia,
with applications in proving algorithm correctness,
geometry, complexity theory, compiler design, etc.

I encourage everyone to come, as this is undoubtedly one
of the most useful skills I have learned at Georgia Tech.
