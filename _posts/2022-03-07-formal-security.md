Today Neil talked about a variety of (symmetric)
cryptography topics and formal security models for them.

In order of likelihood that we'll get to them, topics include: one-time-pad,
perfect secrecy, block ciphers and their modes of operation, IND-CPA, IND-CCA,
PRF, hash functions, collision-resistance, the Merkle-Damg√•rd construction,
and hash-length extension attacks.
