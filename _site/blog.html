        <h4 class="info">Jan 14, 2019</h4>
        <p>First meeting of the semester was a problem session! We had donuts as well as a few very interesting problems about
discrete structures, probability, and set theory.
The slides for the problem session are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cAq-9GU3H-qxc3b5Mr-9oRnub0Dqy35unSzF9FrdEpw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

        <p>This week, Sherry gave a lecture/problem session on the Happy Ending Problem, a popular field of mathematics created by P. Erdös, G. Szekeres, and E. Klein. This problem is very interesting for its connections to Ramsey theory. Her main reference is this <a href="http://neeldhara.com/ramblings/notes/cgt-01">website</a>.

        <p>We had our first faculty talk by Dr. Jacob Abernethy today! Dr. Abernethy recently joined GT as part of the theoretical CS department. He currently teaches CS 4540 (Advanced Algorithms) and Graduate ML Theory. His talk was on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed bandit problem</a> and more generally, solving zero-sum games without the iid requirements that are prevalent in much of ML theory today.
