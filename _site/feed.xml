        <title>Donut Problem Session</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First meeting of the semester was a problem session! We had donuts as well as a few very interesting problems about
discrete structures, probability, and set theory.
The slides for the problem session are &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cAq-9GU3H-qxc3b5Mr-9oRnub0Dqy35unSzF9FrdEpw/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the problems in one nice pdf are &lt;a href=&quot;/files/DonutProblemSession.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deletion Codes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For our final meeting of the semester, we had professor Venkat Guruswami present a talk on deletion codes, a subset of error-correction codes. Thank you to everyone who came to Big O this semester! We’ll see you next year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides for the talk are &lt;a href=&quot;/files/deletion-codes.pptx&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oracles in Complexity Theory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A guest appearance by our faculty talks coordinator DeVon, we had an introduction to oracles. Additionally, he talked about Bounded Error Quantum Polynomial Time (BQP) vs. Polynomial Hierarchy (PH) and barriers to proofs in complexity theory. The slides are &lt;a href=&quot;/files/oraclescomplexity.pptx&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy Ending Problem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, Sherry gave a lecture/problem session on the Happy Ending Problem, a popular field of mathematics created by P. Erdös, G. Szekeres, and E. Klein. This problem is very interesting for its connections to Ramsey theory. Her main reference is this &lt;a href=&quot;http://neeldhara.com/ramblings/notes/cgt-01&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another faculty talk, this week we had and introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods by Dr. Eric Vigoda! MCMC methods are super useful in approximating the size #P to count sets, the volume of hard to calculate integrals, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spectral Algorithms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had another faculty talk this week, about how graphs, linear algebra, and algorithms come together in Spectral Algorithms by Dr. Richard Peng. Here is the full abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of large scale data sets in machine learning, statistics, and scientific computing is making increasing use of high performance algorithmic primitives. Tools such as linear systems solvers and convex optimization solvers are integrated in programming languages such as MATLAB, Python, and Julia, and taught as programming constructs in classes. On the other hand, the ever-increasing scale of data, as well as growth in data sources, creates a multitude of new challenges for these primitives: the running times of many, if not most, implementations of linear system solvers and convex optimization tools scale super-linearly with input sizes.
Over the past three decades, works related to efficient solvers for a class of graph structured matrices, graph Laplacians, led to fundamental results in combinatorial optimization and scientific computing as well as the Laplacian paradigm for graph algorithms. In this talk I will survey these progresses, with focus on the underlying algorithm design approaches. Specifically, I will discuss the origin of algorithms that combine combinatorial and numerical building blocks via spectral graph theory, and describe recent efforts on designing new tools tailored towards the overall algorithmic questions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spooky Problem Session</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Halloween! We had an adeptly themed problem session led by Arvind this week! You can find the problems &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hmR_X0NY--Zuu3L6LPkOXNbxNwck9BKCCVIPBvDCHE8/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had our first faculty talk by Dr. Jacob Abernethy today! Dr. Abernethy recently joined GT as part of the theoretical CS department. He currently teaches CS 4540 (Advanced Algorithms) and Graduate ML Theory. His talk was on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit&quot;&gt;multi-armed bandit problem&lt;/a&gt; and more generally, solving zero-sum games without the iid requirements that are prevalent in much of ML theory today. Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/600231/top-machine-learning-researcher-jake-abernethy-joins-school-computer-science&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Dr. Abernethy (and his juggling skills).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in an REU, there is a Google doc &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG_0dAAmoaLN1rHJsxfR0EGiiWCum6KZ0sBFW2Gy578/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with helpful information for applying.&lt;/p&gt;
